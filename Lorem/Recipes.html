		<h3>Korean Hagfish</h3>
		<p>
			"To prepare them, they are sliced down the middle to remove the digestive tract, then marinated in a sauce used for Korean 
			barbecue. Traditionally, the raw fish are then placed on a heated plate at the center of the table, where they are cooked
			and served, using scissors to slice the hagfish up. The cooked fish are moved to the side of the dish, with 
			lettuce and gochujang (spices), no amount of which can mask the animal's distinct taste. The head, containing the skull is left 
			on the fish, and if a foreigner dines with Koreans, the honor will be offered to the foreigner."
		</p>
		<p>
			In the Corean culture the slime of the hagfish is used as a substitute for egg or eggwhite. The hagfish are being held in a big container
			and then iritated (for example with a stick) and the slime that comes out of the hagfish is then harvested.
